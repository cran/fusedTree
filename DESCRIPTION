Description: Fit (generalized) linear regression models in each leaf node of a tree.
    The tree is constructed using clinical variables only. The linear regression
    models are constructed using (high-dimensional) omics variables only. The
    leaf-node-specific regression models are estimated using the penalized likelihood
    including a standard ridge (L2) penalty and a fusion penalty that links the
    leaf-node-specific regression models to one another. The intercepts of the
    leaf nodes reflect the effects of the clinical variables and are left
    unpenalized. The tree, fitted with the clinical variables only,
    should be constructed outside of the package with the 'rpart' 'R' package.

    on the method.
